--  A simple example that blinks all the LEDs simultaneously, w/o tasking.
--  It does not use the various convenience functions defined elsewhere, but
--  instead works directly with the GPIO driver to configure and control the
--  LEDs.

--  Note that this code is independent of the specific MCU device and board
--  in use because we use names and constants that are common across all of
--  them. For example, "All_LEDs" refers to different GPIO pins on different
--  boards, and indeed defines a different number of LEDs on different boards.
--  The gpr file determines which board is actually used.
